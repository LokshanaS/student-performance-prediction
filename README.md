🎓 Student Performance Prediction System

This is a beginner-level Machine Learning mini project that predicts whether a student will PASS or FAIL based on academic details like attendance, internal marks, and assignment marks.
The project is implemented from scratch using Python and basic ML concepts.

📌 Project Objective

To analyze student academic data and predict student performance using a simple Logistic Regression model.
This project helps beginners understand:

 1. Data handling
 2. Machine learning workflow
 3. Model training and prediction

🛠️ Technologies Used

🐍 Python
🗂️ Pandas
🤖 Scikit-learn
📊 Logistic Regression
💻 VS Code

⚙️ How the Project Works

1. Load the dataset using Pandas
2. Split data into input (features) and output (labels)
3. Train a Logistic Regression model
4. Accept user input from terminal
5. Predict whether the student will PASS or FAIL

📌 Future Improvements

 -> Add more features (study hours, exam scores)
 -> Improve accuracy using more data
 -> Convert to a web application
 -> Add data visualization
